# Mortys-Mind-Bloggers
Morty's Mind Bloggers is a place for Rick and Morty fans can live and hangout until the next season comes out(takes forever).
Rick and Morty is a show that seems familiar, because it is. It started out as parody to Back to the future where they depict a grandfather(Rick) who is basically an altered version of Doc, and a grandson(morty) who travels along with Rick on Adventures!

## Here's What the Home Page of the App looks like!

## Technologies
This Project consisted of the use of Vanilla JS, CSS, Embedded JS, Express, OAuth, and CRUD.

## Icebox Items

In the Future, I would deifinitely would like to revise and finish a little bit more of the styling and CRUD so that I can be proud of an App that is actually fully function.
