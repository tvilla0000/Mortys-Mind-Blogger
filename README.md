# Mortys-Mind-Bloggers
Morty's Mind Bloggers is a place for Rick and Morty fans can live and hangout until the next season comes out(takes forever). User's will be able to create and delete comments 
 if Rick and Morty is a show that seems familiar, it's probably because it is. It started out as parody to Back to the future where they depict a grandfather(Rick) who is basically an altered version of Doc, and a grandson(morty) who displays an altered version of marty, who also travels along with Rick on Adventures!

## Here's What the Home Page of the App looks like!

## Icebox Items

In the Future, I would deifinitely would like to revise and finish a little bit more of the styling and CRUD so that I can be proud of an App that is actually fully function. I would also like to consume an API to display more information and structure the App better.
